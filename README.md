## by Mohamed Salem ALi


## Dataset

The dataset consisted of borrower APRs and attributes of 113,937 loans. The attributes included original loan amount, borrower's P
rosper rating, loan term, borrower's stated monthly income, as well as many other features such as borrower's employment status, debt to income ratio, current loan status etc. 
The dataset can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv), 
with feature documentation available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0)

## Summary of Findings
I wanted to find out which features were the best indicators for predicting the highest rate of return.
I visualized the following features:
### Numerical Features
1. Estimated Returns
2. Borrower APR
3. Stated Monthly Income
4. Debt to Income Ratio
5. Loan Original Amount
### Categorical Features
1. Income Range
2. Credit Grade
3. Employment Statu
4. Term
5. ProsperRating 
## Key Insights for Presentation
I begin with introducing the features of interest one by one, followed by how they relate to one another and eventually how they correlate with estimated returns and BorrowerAPR
